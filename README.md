# Detecting Sleep States using Deep Learning

This repo hosts our team's homework project for the course [Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA](http://smartlab.tmit.bme.hu/oktatas-deep-learning). The project is a solution for the [Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/) Kaggle competition.

## Files
- data_analysis.ipynb - data visualization and analysis
- main_cpd.ipynb - solution using change point detection and CNN, runs in Colab with the Open in Colab button
- main_msc.ipynb - solution using momentary state classification, runs in kaggle (exceeds colab ram limit). You need to add the 'child mind institute - detect sleep states' dataset to your kaggle notebook to run it.
