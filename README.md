## Disclaimer: work in progress
We will be writing a Medium article, and our work is not finished. We will finalize the notebooks and documentation in one or two days.

### Dataset source
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states/

### Files
- data_analysis.ipynb - data visualization and analysis
- main_cnn.ipynb - solution using CNN, runs in colab with the open in colab button (requires the additional evaluation.py file)
- main_lstm.ipynb - solution using LSTM, runs in kaggle (exceeds colab ram limit). You need to add the 'child mind institute - detect sleep states' dataset to your kaggle notebook to run it.
- evaluation.py - required by the solutions to run, this code is provided by the competition for scoring
- documentation.pdf - project documentation
- doc/* - documentation sources

### Training, evaluation

Included in the solution files.
