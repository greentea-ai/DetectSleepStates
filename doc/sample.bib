ABSTRACT = {Sleep is vital for one&rsquo;s general well-being, but it is often neglected, which has led to an increase in sleep disorders worldwide. Indicators of sleep disorders, such as sleep interruptions, extreme daytime drowsiness, or snoring, can be detected with sleep analysis. However, sleep analysis relies on visuals conducted by experts, and is susceptible to inter- and intra-observer variabilities. One way to overcome these limitations is to support experts with a programmed diagnostic tool (PDT) based on artificial intelligence for timely detection of sleep disturbances. Artificial intelligence technology, such as deep learning (DL), ensures that data are fully utilized with low to no information loss during training. This paper provides a comprehensive review of 36 studies, published between March 2013 and August 2020, which employed DL models to analyze overnight polysomnogram (PSG) recordings for the classification of sleep stages. Our analysis shows that more than half of the studies employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings for sleep stage classification and achieved high performance. Our study also underscores that CNN models, particularly one-dimensional CNN models, are advantageous in yielding higher accuracies for classification. More importantly, we noticed that EEG alone is not sufficient to achieve robust classification results. Future automated detection systems should consider other PSG recordings, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG), and electromyogram (EMG) signals, along with input from human experts, to achieve the required sleep stage classification robustness. Hence, for DL methods to be fully realized as a practical PDT for sleep stage scoring in clinical applications, inclusion of other PSG recordings, besides EEG recordings, is necessary. In this respect, our report includes methods published in the last decade, underscoring the use of DL models with other PSG recordings, for scoring of sleep stages.},

    abstract = "{Multisensor wearable consumer devices allowing the collection of multiple data sources, such as heart rate and motion, for the evaluation of sleep in the home environment, are increasingly ubiquitous. However, the validity of such devices for sleep assessment has not been directly compared to alternatives such as wrist actigraphy or polysomnography (PSG).Eight participants each completed four nights in a sleep laboratory, equipped with PSG and several wearable devices. Registered polysomnographic technologist-scored PSG served as ground truth for sleep–wake state. Wearable devices providing sleep–wake classification data were compared to PSG at both an epoch-by-epoch and night level. Data from multisensor wearables (Apple Watch and Oura Ring) were compared to data available from electrocardiography and a triaxial wrist actigraph to evaluate the quality and utility of heart rate and motion data. Machine learning methods were used to train and test sleep–wake classifiers, using data from consumer wearables. The quality of classifications derived from devices was compared.For epoch-by-epoch sleep–wake performance, research devices ranged in d′ between 1.771 and 1.874, with sensitivity between 0.912 and 0.982, and specificity between 0.366 and 0.647. Data from multisensor wearables were strongly correlated at an epoch-by-epoch level with reference data sources. Classifiers developed from the multisensor wearable data ranged in d′ between 1.827 and 2.347, with sensitivity between 0.883 and 0.977, and specificity between 0.407 and 0.821.Data from multisensor consumer wearables are strongly correlated with reference devices at the epoch level and can be used to develop epoch-by-epoch models of sleep–wake rivaling existing research devices.}",

ABSTRACT={The classification of sleep stages is the first and an important step in the quantitative analysis of polysomnographic recordings. Sleep stage scoring relies heavily on visual pattern recognition by a human expert and is time consuming and subjective. Thus, there is a need for automatic classification. In this work we developed machine learning algorithms for sleep classification: random forest (RF) classification based on features and artificial neural networks (ANNs) working both with features and raw data. We tested our methods in healthy subjects and in patients. Most algorithms yielded good results comparable to human interrater agreement. Our study revealed that deep neural networks (DNNs) working with raw data performed better than feature-based methods. We also demonstrated that taking the local temporal structure of sleep into account a priori is important. Our results demonstrate the utility of neural network architectures for the classification of sleep.}
